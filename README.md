# Cocktail-Finder
A program written in python-flask that takes user input, and returns recipes of cocktails based on the user input from a MySQL database.
The MySQL database was hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Unfortunately, they only provide free service for 1 month before they charge. So the database is no longer active.
